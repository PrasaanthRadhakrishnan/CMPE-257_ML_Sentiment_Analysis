0,An instant funk classic. Absolutely stanky
1,"Hands down, Theo Katzman is one of the best lamp players of this generation"
2,"When I heard this for the first time, I divorced my wife, sold all my possessions, took all my money and bought 3 things, a bass, an amp, and a trailer. I have been living thusly, in the deep of the most forgotten woods, naked, playing funk bass non stop, 24/7, for the past 7 years. I emerge only now, once, to post this singular message, before I return to the bass.  I regret nothing. *Nothing*."
3,i love how one of the greatest studio bass performances of the last half-century was performed in a living room while sitting on an exercise bench
4,"Just think - if Jack hadn't shouted ""Yo,"" to get em out of the bridge, this recording could've gone on for 3 hours instead of 3 minutes."
5,I've got a fever and the only prescription is more bassline.
6,Yo Joe Dart is absolutely ruthless on the bass but Theo independently doing those upbeats on the high hat and maintaining tempo without slipping is very impressive too
7,"Just now sitting down to learn this bass line...I've got a shakey 75% speed going, but I'm determined Mr. Dart."
8,"""What do you play?""

""The hi-hat and lamp"""
9,"This was my first vulf song I ever heard. Probably the best introduction to them I could‚Äôve ever had. Friend sent me the song, and I ended up listening to it for 3 hours straight while driving somewhere. Never gets old"
10,"Every time you think Joe Dart is about to miss a beat, he puts it in the pocket in the pocket in the back pocket."
11,"As a bass player that's just stumbled across this for the first time, I am truly amazed. I need to start learning how to play this!"
12,I love this video immensely. Every single one of them look like they‚Äôre enjoying themselves and are having fun. That is how it should always be.
13,"Thank you Joe Dart for this amazing bassline, has been such a joy to learn and even improv on after my breakup with the wife. 
Haven't touched my bass in almost 11 years, but apparently haven't forgotten a damn thing. 
Thanks again, and all of you associated with Vulfpeck."
14,My dopamine production increases exponentially when those keyboard chords start elevating this groove @ 2:03
15,Interesting how their whole band is a rhythm section.
16,"After many weeks of thinking, I have came to the real question of life: Why isn't there an endless version of this?"
17,I feel this is the perfect song to improve your bass skills.  Speed precision endurance.   Seriously all bass players get this song under your belt because I know I do.
18,"Glad I found this - turned 60yrs old recently, this would have been a miss for sure - thanks to Scott Devine's Bass Lessons I now have a new muse."
19,I always love the way Theo is just vibing extremely hard to the song on that hi-hat and lapshade. You can clearly see he's loving every second of it
20,This bassist is probably the funkiest I‚Äôve heard that doesn‚Äôt do slap bass
21,"Revisiting the original after listening to Cory Wong's new cover version. Man, this such an excellent minimalist composition!! What legends"
22,"I've seen this 3+ years ago and I've been completely infatuated with Vulfpeck ever since. But back then this video confused me as much as it enticed me. Such weird decor, the clothes that are just all over the place, everything from the leather-clad fauxhawk on guitar, the two takes it took me to see what's up with the drums...the first thing I thought was 'what is this?!' both in regard to how disgustingly funky and tight it is and in regard to what it looks like.

But the weirder thing is, when I look at it now once more, the same stuff still applies. It's not Cory Wong, who I've been worshipping for a year now, it's the weird fauxhawk. It's not Joe....Dart, on the fen-der-bass, it's the scruffy-looking funkgod. It's not stranger than fiction Jack Stratton, it's the dude who is a genius for laying a groove like that, like that. And beyond all, it's not Theo Katzman with all his songwriting genius, it's GTA-Trevor with 60's glasses and a glass lamp shade. 

Brings tears to my eyes."
23,Thank you for this. I had recently lost my faith in music and this showed me that there are still musicians out there with actual talent and appreciation for all the greats that paved the way.
24,"Soon we will celebrate the 5th birthday of this amazing tune!
Thank you, Vulfpeck, for delivering so much funk in all these years! ‚ù§Ô∏èüé∏"
25,"*–≠—Ç–æ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –∫—Ä—É—Ç–æ* !
–ü–æ–¥–ø–∏—Å–∞–ª—Å—è!"
26,"Since the live version was posted, every time I listen to this one I get goose bumps, knowing that I'm not the only one who sings along. Many, many heartfelt thanks for this most astoundingly excellent piece. <3"
27,Hipn√≥tico muy bueno üî•üî•üî•üëåüéµ
28,"Their groove is sickly, infectious. Love it."
29,That bass line has its own zip code.
30,I love the bassline. ü•∞ üé∂
31,"Jack Stratton - bops head with some gravity, getting that BASS drum in good time whilst muffling that snare heavily

Theo Katzman - concentration on that hi-hat, can‚Äôt get enough metal cone and channelling inner anger

Woody Goss - slight confusion as he looks through his glasses, swaying his head a little adding many offbeats to his already offbeat harmony

Cory Wong - tapping his whole leg in time with the rhythm, stank face at every riff and that iconic head shake even if it‚Äôs out of time

Joe Dart - can‚Äôt get enough semis, and has his epic pigeon bop; head extensions like he‚Äôs the bass drum of this BASS RIFF

Cameraman (Tyler Duncan) - filming as if he‚Äôs just missed something important- oh wait, a cat, I should get that in fra- wait no gotta get that sock cymbal- C‚ÄôMON MR KING OF WURLITZER"
32,I love that bass!!!
33,theo‚Äôs face when he‚Äôs playing the drums never fails to make me laugh
34,0:52 Brother on the keys knew exactly what kind of dump trunk of stank they were about to drop. Holy shit that was insanely well played thank you!
35,first song i heard from those guys...in love since then
36,"Woaaaah, esto es geniaaaal, que pena que no lo encontr√© antesssss."
37,"I stumbled into this vid, and instantly liked the groove‚Ä¶Joe has some mad 16th note chops, he def is a Jaco fan , and Rocco Prestia I bet also"
38,this is my absolutely favorite funky song in my music history
39,This is so fantastic üëçüèº well done
40,"I legit thought this song was going to be one of those 70s songs. Then after a tiny bit of research I realized it isn't. 
What an absolute revival of the time though! Great riffing I should learn as a bass player."
41,"I love this song so much that I'm teared apart. I wanna listen to it all the time but if I do so I know I will grow tired of it so I have to restrain! So far so good, after 3 years I'm still loving it :)"
42,Is anybody here a fish vet? _This bass is sick_
43,EXCELENTE!!! Lo CLASICO nunca muere!
44,this came on unexpectedly and my jaw dropped involuntarily and i started spasmodically grooving while being unable to breathe. i'm going to learn that bassline right now.
45,Y'all became one of my new favorite bands recently.  Honored to be a fan!

52,vulfpeck is one of the most consistently amazing groups i've ever heard

54,On top of this being an epic jam session this also has some top tier video editing. I love it
55,This is no doubt my favorite bass line of all time
56,You guys are insanely groovy! And that bass had me! Love from India!
57,It's the face he makes when he's playing the lamp that does it for me.
58,"Now being used for TV and radio promos on Australia's national broadcaster the A.B.C. Hope Vulf  are getting a good deal, they're getting played a lot."
59,"I'm continually amazed at how rock steady this beat is, it's hypnotic."
60,"each time Im listening to this, it makes me want to hold my bass"
61,J' √©coute en boucle le clavier a partir de 2'03 une tuerie et l impression de voir Joe McMillan de Halt catch and fire
62,"I don't always listen to Vulfpeck...but when I do, so do my neighbors"
63,"Gotta love Jack's little tricks on bass drum here and there, it gets even groovier than it already is! Sick funk!"
64,Esse som √© bom demais rapazes!!!
65,I love how they begin vibing and then descend into absolute madness and slaughter.
66,Clearly the Bass stands out but the whole band just brings everything together. This is a work of art.
67,You know the shit is funky when everyone looks like they just caught a whiff of some dog poo
68,"Deveras interessante esse som
Muito bom"
69,"I'm just saying, I've never seen Joe Dart's right hand and a v8 piston in the same room"
70,"Exhilarating to watch this, then watch them do it live at Madison Square Garden, with the audience singing the bass line ( my brothers/sisters all ! )"
71,Absolutely freakin' amazing...
72,"That little b3-1 stinger thing at 2:37.  Favorite part of the whole thing, and so simple...fits perfectly."
73,words cannot express how vulpeck has changed my life. Thank you guys so much. just  a couple dudes funking out.
74,The song is brilliant and I can't stop listening to it.
75,Just used this to eject water out of my phone speakers. Thank you Vulf for the phat bass and the not-so-low-volume funk!
76,This is so funky I smelled it from 3 videos away.
77,That ending was so freaking smooth
78,"Woody doesn't get enough credits for this song, both as the composer as a genius minimal key part."
79,Un putain de grooveüí™
80,That unison at the end is just spectacular!
81,Man I'd get tendonitis from trying to pluck the bass that fast. Nicely done!
82,Love the sound and the groove.  Top Notch!
83,I declare this the FUNKIEST MOMENT OF ALL OF HUMAN HISTORY
84,I love the open E zoom in on the guitar at 3:20
85,"Everyone is paying attention to the bass and percussion, but how cool are the keys?"
86,Yo!!! This one never gets old.
87,The bass player was born on that stool and it just grew with him. That‚Äôs evolution right there.
88,"everytime i have a bad day, i blast this pure joy."
89,one of the best songs of the last few years.
90,"Today I discovered Vulfpeck. Tomorrow I leave the house with a new walk, full of funk...."
91,I've repeated 1:02 - 1:05 for about a million times now. That was smooth af.
92,"ABSOLUTAMENTE ASOMBROSO, LO USARE COMO SAMPLE, SERIA UN HONOR, GRACIAS POR TAN BUENA CANCION CSMR"
93,In over 30 years of playing I've never had a bassline give me so much trouble to learn! Mr Dart you are indeed beastly! üòé
94,This song is really a master piece!
95,"Bass guitarist has the moves of a rooster with plenty of food at his feet, but he ain't hungry, just leaving it for his hens. So tight."
96,This is why YouTube is just amazing. Having a nostalgic sing along to Pastorius on Teen Town. Forty years since it first went on my teenage turntable. And this is offered. From nowhere.
97,When that first Wurli chord hits... Woody is a god.
98,It always makes me laugh how the camera pans so fast you don't see Cory... And then when they finally show him he's just sitting there digging the groove. Don't know why I find it so funny. Every song and video is just... Good God these guys are so talented-  so locked in
99,Favorite first 0.01 of a second of any song ever. The way the drums roll into beat 2. 0:00
